For my t-shirt design, I decided to use my own artistic abilities to draw the initial images myself and have the creative process be entirely through my own work! 

**The images used:**

The first image is a tv/monitor character, which is meant to represent data science and the connection between traditional programming and machine learning. Traditional program requires the programmer to manually figure out the rules that are involved in getting the answers we want. However, for machines, in machine learning, the machines themselves figure out the rules for the programmer. It does the thinking for the programmer. That is what inspired the first image.

As for the second image, it is a painting of clouds. Personally, I really like the dreamy look of clouds so I really wanted to incorporate that into the t-shirt design. Secondly, it also serves as a representation of us aiming for the dreams that we have, whatever they may be, through our journey in the Jump Start to Data Science program.

**The process:**
After running the code, due to the colors used, it was a bit difficult getting the colors to show up in the image...

However, I came to this result after a couple long minutes of waiting for the code to run:

**The final result:**

Although the coding ended up with a pretty cool result, I felt that it was a little too dull and I wanted to go back in and retouch it. Using a bit of photoshop, I enhanced the lines of the tv/monitor character I had used and lessened the dullness of the image by overlaying the original cloud painting, while still keeping the new cloudlike pattern created from the code. Below is the result:

I had also made a second version that included a text that says "data science" across the pattern:

**Example of how it looks on a shirt:**

Using the two images created in *the final result*, I wanted to see how it would possibly look like on a t-shirt and these are the two designs that I had come up with:
