I am currently working on getting the image files to be imported into the code although I am having some difficulties at the moment.
While I am trying to get the images to be inputted I would like to share the images I plan to use:
[image](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67992204/87884923-aae13f80-c9df-11ea-88dd-ac10d1c29fae.png))

both of these are images I personally designed/tweaked. The top one is the pycharm logo but repurposed to say Jump Start to Data Science. I thought it would be fitting to use for the Data Science program as we do use Pycharm. The second image is a digital painting of clouds that I have made. I thought about making clouds just because it is dreamy and it is a representation of us aiming for the dreams that we have, whatever they may be, through our journey in the Jump Start to Data Science program.
